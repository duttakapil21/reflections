Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A. When a repo is initialized using 'git init', git starts tracking that repo and saving snapshots of it for every commit. It is requied if you want to track a file/folder using Git and save multiple version of it for future use.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. The staging area is temporary list to which you can add all the files that you'll like to commit. It gives you a lot more control over which files are tracked and taken a snapshot of to be added in a commit.
